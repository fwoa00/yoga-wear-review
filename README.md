The brand invests heavily in fabric innovation, developing proprietary materials like Everlux for sweat-wicking and Luxtreme for compression that feels supportive without restrictive. While price points sit firmly in premium territory, the durability justifies the investment—these pieces maintain shape and color integrity through years of regular wear and washing.

Their LiveOn program accepts old yoga mats from any brand and transforms them into home insulation materials through The Renewable Workshop.

While Manduka's clothing line remains smaller than their mat collection, each piece gets carefully curated for functionality and sustainability.

Sweaty Betty's UK origins influence their aesthetic, bringing a slightly different energy than California-based brands—think bold florals, animal prints, and color combinations that embrace maximalism rather than minimalist neutrals.

## FAQ

**What makes yoga clothing different from regular activewear?**

Yoga clothing prioritizes four-way stretch for unrestricted movement through poses, flat seams that won't irritate during floor work, and high-waisted designs that stay put during inversions. Unlike running gear focused on forward motion, yoga wear must accommodate twisting, bending, and extreme flexibility without restricting range or creating uncomfortable bunching.

**How do I choose between budget and premium yoga brands?**

Consider frequency of practice and specific needs—if you practice daily or attend heated classes, investing in premium fabrics from brands like Lululemon or Alo Yoga offers better durability and sweat management. For occasional practitioners or those building initial wardrobes, mid-range brands like Fabletics, Girlfriend Collective, or Yoga Democracy provide excellent quality-to-cost ratios without sacrificing functionality.

**Do sustainable yoga brands actually perform as well as traditional activewear?**

Modern sustainable brands like Girlfriend Collective, Prana, and Teeki have closed the performance gap entirely, using recycled materials and organic fabrics that match or exceed traditional synthetics in durability, compression, and moisture management. The key difference lies in environmental impact during production rather than end-user performance, meaning eco-conscious choices no longer require functionality compromises.
